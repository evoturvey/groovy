GroovyServlet examples

[ / ]
Only contains this readme file. For clarity sake, it does not contain a welcome
file and therefore the servlet container should list all subdirectories listed
below.

[ /hello ]
Contains a single welcome file named "index.groovy" showing a simple groovlet.

[ /zoo ]
The zoo demonstrates a groovy setup of scripts, that are partly <i>hidden</i>
beneath the "WEB-INF/groovy" directory. Note the different package names in the
script files.

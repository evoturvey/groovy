Working with BSF 



1 Working with BSF

Groovy integrates cleanly with {link:BSF|http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/} (the Bean Scripting Framework) which allows you to embed any scripting engine 
into your Java code while keeping your Java code decoupled from any particular 
scripting engine specifics. 

The BSF engine for Groovy is implementated by the {link:GroovyEngine|apidocs/org/codehaus/groovy/bsf/GroovyEngine.html} class.
From bsf 2.3.0-rc2 onwards the integration should be included in the release of BSF
although until then you'll need to manually register this class with your BSF installation.
You can manually register Groovy into BSF via the following... 

{code:groovysh}
BSFManager.registerScriptingEngine(
	"groovy", 
	"org.codehaus.groovy.bsf.GroovyEngine", 
	new String[] { "groovy", "gy" }
);
{code}

You can then treat Groovy like any of the other scripting languages via the BSF API... 

{code:groovysh}
String text = "println('Hello World')\n  return [1, 2, 3]"
BSFManager manager = new BSFManager();
Object answer = manager.eval("groovy", "Test1.groovy", 0, 0, text);
{code}

If you want to see more examples of using Groovy with BSF you could try the {link:unit test cases|http://cvs.groovy.codehaus.org/viewcvs.cgi/groovy/groovy-core/src/test/org/codehaus/groovy/bsf/BSFTest.java?rev=HEAD&view=auto}

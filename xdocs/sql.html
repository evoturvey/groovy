<h1>GroovySql: Making SQL more Groovy</h1>

<p>
Groovy supports a few neat ways to work with SQL more easily. 
You can perform queries and SQL statements, passing in variables easily with proper handling
of statements, connections and exception handling thanks to closures.
</p>

<source>
foo = 'cheese'
sql.queryEach("select * from FOOD where type=${foo}") { 
	println("Gromit likes ${it.name}") 
}
</source>

<p>
Or you can create a DataSet which allows you to query SQL using familar closure syntax 
so that the same query could work easily on in memory objects or via SQL. e.g.
</p>

<source>
food = sql.dataSet('FOOD')
cheese = food.findAll { it.type == 'cheese' }
cheese.each { println("Eat ${it.name}") }
</source>

<p>
There's an example <a href="http://cvs.groovy.codehaus.org/viewcvs.cgi/groovy/groovy-core/src/test/groovy/gdo/SqlCompleteTest.groovy?rev=HEAD&view=auto">test case which demonstrates</a> all of these query mechanisms in action.

<h1>Running Groovy scripts</h1>

<p>
Groovy scripts are a number of statements and class declarations in a text file.
Groovy scripts can be used similarly to other scripting languages.
There are various ways of running Groovy scripts...
</p>

<h2>Running Groovy scripts from your IDE</h2>

<p>
There is a helper class called <a href="apidocs/groovy/lang/GroovyShell.html">GroovyShell</a> 
which has a main(String[]) method for running any Groovy script. 
You can run any groovy script as follows
</p>

<source>
java groovy.lang.GroovyShell foo/MyScript.groovy [arguments]
</source>

<p>
You can then run the above Groovy main() in your IDE to run or debug any Groovy script.
</p>

<h2>Running Groovy scripts from the command line</h2>

<p>
There are shell scripts called 'groovy' or 'groovy.bat' depending on your platform
which is part of the Groovy runtime.
Once the runtime is installed (see below for more detail) 
you can just run groovy like any other script...
</p>

<source>
groovy foo/MyScript.groovy [arguments]
</source>

<p>
To work from the latest and greatest Groovy, do a cvs checkout and then type
</p>

<source>
maven groovy:make-install
</source>

<p>
You'll then have a full binary distribution made for you in groovy/target/install.
You can then add groovy/target/install/bin to your path and you can then run groovy scripts
easily from the command line.

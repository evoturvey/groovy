<h1>Running Groovy scripts</h1>

<p>
Groovy scripts are a number of statements and class declarations in a text file.
Groovy scripts can be used similarly to other scripting languages.
There are various ways of running Groovy scripts...
</p>

<h2>Running Groovy scripts from your IDE</h2>

<p>
There is a helper class called <a href="apidocs/groovy/lang/GroovyShell.html">GroovyShell</a> 
which has a main(String[]) method for running any Groovy script. 
You can run any groovy script as follows
</p>

<source>
java groovy.lang.GroovyShell foo/MyScript.groovy [arguments]
</source>

<p>
You can then run the above Groovy main() in your IDE to run or debug any Groovy script.
</p>

<h2>Running Groovy scripts from the command line</h2>

<p>
There are shell scripts called 'groovy' or 'groovy.bat' depending on your platform
which is part of the Groovy runtime.
Once the runtime is installed (see below for more detail) 
you can just run groovy like any other script...
</p>

<source>
groovy foo/MyScript.groovy [arguments]
</source>

<p>
To work from the latest and greatest Groovy, do a cvs checkout and then type
</p>

<source>
maven groovy:make-install
</source>

<p>
You'll then have a full binary distribution made for you in groovy/target/install.
You can then add groovy/target/install/bin to your path and you can then run groovy scripts
easily from the command line.
</p>

<h2>Creating Unix scripts with Groovy</h2>

<p>
You can write unix scripts with Groovy and execute them directly on the command line as 
if they were normal unix shell scripts. Providing you have installed the Groovy binary
distribution (see above) and 'groovy' is on your PATH then the following should work.
There now follows a sample script which is 
<a href="http://cvs.groovy.codehaus.org/viewcvs.cgi/groovy/groovy-core/src/script/helloWorld?rev=HEAD">in CVS</a>. 
Save it as helloWorld.</p>

<source>
#!/usr/bin/env groovy
println("Hello world")
for (a in this.args) {
  println("Argument: " + a)
}	
</source>

<p>
Then to run the script from the command line, just make sure the script is executable then you 
can call it
</p>

<source>
chmod +x helloWorld
./helloWorld
</source>

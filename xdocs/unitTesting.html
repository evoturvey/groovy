<h1>Unit Testing with Groovy</h1>

<p>
By default Groovy unit test cases generate java bytecode and so are just the same
as any other Java unit test cases. One thing to watch is often Ant / Maven look 
for *.java files to find unit tests with pattern matching, rather than *.class files.
There's an option in Maven to ensure you search for classes (and so find any Groovy 
unit test cases) via this property
</p>

<source>
maven.test.search.classdir = true
</source>

<p>
Once you've got this enabled you can use Maven goals to run individual test cases like this
</p>

<source>
maven test:single -Dtestcase=foo.MyGroovyTest
</source>


<h2>Running GroovyUnitTests in IDEs</h2>

<p>
Most IDEs support JUnit but maybe don't yet handle Groovy (shame!:).
Firstly if you compile the groovy code to bytecode, then it'll just work in any JUnit IDE just fine.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes though you want to just hack the unit test script and run from in your IDE without
doing a build. 
If you're IDE doesn't automatically recompile Groovy for you then there's 
a utility to help you run Groovy unit test cases inside any JUnit IDE without needing to 
run your Ant / Maven build.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="apidocs/groovy/util/GroovyTestSuite.html">GroovyTestSuite</a> class 
is a JUnit TestSuite which will compile and run a GroovyUnit test case
from a command line argument (when run as an application) or from the <b>test</b> system property
when run as a JUnit test suite.
</p>

<p>
To run the GroovyUnitTest as an application, just do the equivalent of this in your IDE
</p>

<source>
java groovy.util.GroovyTestSuite src/test/Foo.groovy
</source>

<p>
Or to run the test suite inside your IDE, just run the GroovyTestSuite test 
with this system property defined
</p>

<source>
-Dtest=src/test/Foo.groovy
</source>


<p>
Either of the above can really help improve the development experience of writing 
Groovy unit test cases in IDEs that don't yet support Groovy natively.

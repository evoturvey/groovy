This document describes how to install a binary distribution of Groovy. 
For those familiar with tools like {link:Ant|http://ant.apache.org/} or {link:Maven|http://maven.apache.org/} these steps will be very familiar. 

- {link:download|download.html} a binary distribution of Groovy and unpack the
distribution into some file on your local file system. 
- set your ~~~GROOVY_HOME~~~ environment variable to the directory you unpacked
the distribution 
- add ~~~GROOVY_HOME/bin~~~ to your ~~~PATH~~~ environment variable. 
- you should now have Groovy installed properly. You can test this by typing 
the following in a command shell...

Which should create an interactive groovy shell where you can type Groovy statements.
Or to run the Swing interactive console type

{code}

To run a specific groovy script type 

{code:groovysh}

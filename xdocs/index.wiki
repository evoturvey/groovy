1 Introduction to Groovy

Groovy is a powerful new agile language for the JVM combining lots of great features from languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk 
and making them available to the Java developers using a Java-like syntax. 

Groovy is designed to help you get things done on the Java platform in a quicker, more concise and fun way - bringing the power
of Python and Ruby inside the Java platform. 

Groovy can be used as an alternative compiler to javac to generate standard Java bytecode to be used by any Java project
or it can be used dynamically as an alternative language such as for writing scripts or unit test cases. 

1.1 Features

* {link:Closure support|closures.html} 
* {link:Native syntax for Lists and Maps|http://wiki.codehaus.org/groovy/SyntaxForTuplesListsMaps} 
* {link:Groovy Markup|markup.html} 
* {link:Groovy Path expression language|http://wiki.codehaus.org/groovy/PathExpressionLanguage} 
* {link:Groovlets|servlets.html} for implementing Servlets easily in simple Groovy scripts 
* {link:Groovy SQL|sql.html} for making SQL more Groovy 
* {link:Ant Scripting|ant.html} 
* {link:Regex|regex.html} syntax for neater scripting with regular expressions 
* {link:Groovy Beans|beans.html} for simpler syntax for working with beans 
* {link:Operator Overloading|operators.html} to simplify working with datatypes Collections and Maps 
* Polymorphic iteration and Autoboxing 
* Compiles straight to Java bytecode & works cleanly with all existing Java objects & libraries 


1.1 Examples

Here's a simple example which demonstrates the basic syntax. Notice that Groovy is dynamically typed, has closure support and supports
something similar to Python's tuple / sequence / dictionary support (List and Map in Java) 

{code:groovysh}
class Foo {
  doSomething() {
    data = ["name": "James", "location": "London"]
    for (e in data) {
      println("entry ${e.key} is ${e.value}")
    }
  }
  
  closureExample(collection) {
    collection.each { println("value ${it}") }
  }
  
  static void main(args) {
    values = [1, 2, 3, "abc"]
    foo = new Foo()
    foo.closureExample(values)
    foo.doSomething()
  }
}
{code}

1.1 Getting started

Probably the best way to get started on Groovy is to install Maven, get a {link:CVS checkout|cvs-usage.html} of the source code and then 
try running the unit tests & looking at them to see how Groovy works.
e.g. 

{code:shell}
maven clean test
{code}

Groovy has a Swing interactive console that allows you to type in commmands and execute them
rather like using an SQL query tool. History is available and such like so you can move forwards
and backwards through commands etc. 

To run the Swing console type... 

{code:shell}
maven console
{code}

Or to see a simple example of how Groovy can be used to script things like creating Swing user interfaces try... 

{code:shell}
maven swing:demo
{code}

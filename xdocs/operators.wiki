1 Operator overloading in Groovy

Groovy supports operator overloading which makes working with Numbers, 
Collections, Maps and various other data structures easier to use.

Various operators in Groovy are mapped onto regular Java method calls on objects.
This allows you the developer to provide your own Java or Groovy objects which can take
advantage of operator overloading. The following table describes the operators 
supported in Groovy and the methods they map to.

{table}
Operator | Method 
a + b | a.plus(b)
a - b | a.minus(b)
a * b | a.multiply(b)
a / b | a.divide(b)
a++ or ++a | a.increment()
a\-\- or \-\-a | a.decrement()
a\[b\] | a.get(b)
a\[b\] = c | a.put(b, c)
{table}

Note that all the following comparison operators handle nulls gracefully avoiding 
the throwing of {api:java.lang.NullPointerException}

{table}
Operator | Method 
a == b | a.equals(b)
a != b | ! a.equals(b)
a === b | a == b in Java (i.e. a and b refer to same object instance)
a <=> b | a.compareTo(b)
a > b | a.compareTo(b) > 0
a >= b | a.compareTo(b) >= 0
a < b | a.compareTo(b) < 0
a <= b | a.compareTo(b) <= 0

1 Download Groovy

You can download a distribution of Groovy from {link:this site|http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions/} .
Once you've download the distribution, please read the {link:installation instructions|install.html} . 

If you want to grab just a jar of groovy to embed in your application then try using {link:Maven|http://maven.apache.org/} as your build tool and it'll download it for
you or you can grab a jar from the {link:jar repository|http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/jars/}. 
You could use the snapshot version if you like, this is rebuilt every time a 
change is made in CVS by our continuous integration build.

If you're happy to work directly with {link:Maven|http://maven.apache.org/} then either download a {link:source distribution|http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions/} or {link:grab the code from CVS|cvs-usage.html}

1 Groovy Eclipse

There is a Groovy Eclipse plugin avaiable for editing and running groovy scripts
from inside Eclipse. Its currently in the {link:groovy-eclipse|http://cvs.groovy.codehaus.org/viewcvs.cgi/groovy/ide/groovy-eclipse/} CVS module. 

There's also more up to date details on working with the plugin {link:here|http://wiki.codehaus.org/groovy/HackingEclipsePlugin}

The plugin provides a Groovy editor for editing scripts or classes in Groovy. 
You can also use the editor as a kind of shell / scrapbook. If you install the 
plugin and associate it with *.groovy files, then you can right click on any groovy
file and run it as Groovy directly from the menu. Or you can type in some groovy, 
highlight it in the editor and right click -> Evaluate Groovy.

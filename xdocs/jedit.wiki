1 Groovy jEdit plugin

To use Groovy from inside jEdit download this {link:plugin|http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?SuperScript}.
You'll need a fairly recent jEdit distribution.

Right now BSF isn't yet released with inbuilt Groovy support so you have to add the following code
to the startup script in ~~<jedit.home>\startup\startup.bsh~~

{code:bsh}
org.apache.bsf.BSFManager.registerScriptingEngine("groovy","org.codehaus.groovy.bsf.GroovyEngine",new String[]{"groovy","gv"});
{code}


Restart jEdit. Open SuperScript dockable from Plugins Menu or Dockable 
area and choose "groovy" from the languages dropdown. to test if groovy works fine or no, 
just try running some expression in the textbox or open some groovy script in jEdit and try "Executing Script".

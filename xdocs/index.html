<title>Groovy language for the JVM</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Groovy is a powerful new dynamic language for the JVM combining lots of great features from languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk 
and making them available to the Java developers using a Java-like syntax.<p>
<p>Groovy can be used as an alternative compiler to javac to generate standard Java bytecode to be used by any Java project
or it can be used dynamically as an alternative language such as for writing scripts or unit test cases.
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Here's a simple example which demonstrates the basic syntax. Notice that Groovy is dynamically typed, has closure support and supports
something similar to Python's tuple / sequence / dictionary support (List and Map in Java)
</p>

<source>
class Foo {
  doSomething() {
    data = ["name": "James", "location": "London"];
    for e in data {
      println("property ${e.key} is ${e.value}");
    }
  }
  
  closureExample(collection) {
    collection.each { i :
      println("value ${i}");
    };
  }
  
  static main(args) {
    values = [1, 2, 3, "abc"];
    closureExample(values);
  }
}

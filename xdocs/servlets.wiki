1 Groovlets: Writing Servlets in Groovy

You can write normal Java servlets in Groovy. 
There is also a {link:GroovyServlet|} which automatically compile your .groovy
source files, turn them into bytecode, load the Class and cache it until you
change the source file. 

Here's a simple example to show you the kind of thing you can do from a Groovlet.
Notice the use of implicit variables to access the session, output & request. 

{code:groovlet}
import java.util.Date

if (session.counter == null) {
session.counter = 1
}

out.println(<<<EOS
<html>
<head>
<title>Groovy Servlet</title>
</head>
<body>
Hello, ${request.remoteHost}: ${session.counter}! ${new Date()} 
<br>src
</body>
</html>
EOS)

session.counter = session.counter + 1
{code}
